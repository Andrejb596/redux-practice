# Practical project on React Redux

This is a mini project, at the beginning I make a component, when the component is loaded, comments are loaded from the external `API`. When I receive comments from an external `API`
I can change, delete or add new ones. Next, I'm working on a Middleware that won't skip comments with bad words. I made two buttons on pressing, I can put and remove likes, I also made an input for adding text. All these data are stored centrally in redux.
